TRAINING SET:
65 tables in 15 pdf files in CS folder

Steps:
Pre Processing of pdf to xml output
	Columns - A column will not end in middle of a Table
Creating a web server for annotating text
Implemented CRF --> Collins perceptron
Identifying Features

Tried out:
Restricting to Table Keyword as of now
Decaying the learning rate [as a single learning rate did not work for multiple training examples]

To Show output:
Graphs showing accuracy estimates
Accuracy Estimates using N% Confidence intervals
Varying the number of epochs (with decayed learning rate) and precision recall values
Perform Cross Validation for getting the approximate model (due to lack of training data)
Confusion Matrix

Future Work:
SVM works equally well or better than CRF in all the cases. Initial assumption was CRF to do better. Need to test this with more features and 
Highly dependent on Table keyword location Eg: 7.pdf
Table Keyword presence Eg: 8.pdf
SVM Parameters finding -> Grid Search

Abstract ================= [very important. Be precise]
1 Introduction ================== [talk in terms of time to train and test for CRF??]
2 Related Works ==================== 
3 ML Background: CRF.. CRF how to do inference and training =================== [formula in latex???]
4 Architecture of our Table Extraction system 
	say about pdftohtml. what output it gives.
        fig comes here
5 Table Detection: 
	Pre processing ========================================[Should I put it as an algorithm in latex?????] (Algorithm 1)
	Feature Set
	CRF(Collins perceptron, decayed learning Rate), pyml, LR
	PostProcessing ========================================[Should I put it as an algorithm in latex?????]

6 Table Decomposition:
	?????????????????
7 Experiments and Result analysis: [Your experiments should be motivated by one or more explicitly stated hypotheses or questions]
7.1 Table Detection:
Experiments
We train a CRF, SVM with a Gaussian Kernel and a Logistic Regressor for this classification task and we evaluate their performance. 
testing whether sequence matters
	Pre processing / Annotation of pdf files.
	for all 3 methods:
		Sparse Line PR
		n fold CV with changing the no of epochs and learning rate
		Confusion Matrix
		ROC Curve
		Area under the ROC Curve 
	Sample screen shots
	Discussion: SVM performed better
7.2 =======
8 Code Open Source:
Location of project on Github. (change source code so that can be executed from command line)
Project requisites
How to run the code?

9 Future Work
Learnt that heuristics with ML algorithm performs really well but individually both of them perform poorly.
feature selection is most important and so More features
Evaluation with a real time system
Schema matching and Information Extraction
