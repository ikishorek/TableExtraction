TRAINING SET:
65 tables in 15 pdf files in CS folder

Steps:
Pre Processing of pdf to xml output
	Columns - A column will not end in middle of a Table
Creating a web server for annotating text
Implemented CRF --> Collins perceptron
Identifying Features

Tried out:
Restricting to Table Keyword as of now
Decaying the learning rate [as a single learning rate did not work for multiple training examples]


To Show output:
Graphs showing accuracy estimates
Accuracy Estimates using N% Confidence intervals
Varying the number of epochs (with decayed learning rate) and precision recall values
Perform Cross Validation for getting the approximate model (due to lack of training data)
Confusion Matrix

Future Work:
SVM works equally well or better than CRF in all the cases. Initial assumption was CRF to do better. Need to test this with more features and 
Highly dependent on Table keyword location Eg: 7.pdf
Table Keyword presence Eg: 8.pdf
SVM Parameters finding -> Grid Search
