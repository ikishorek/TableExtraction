Change the Trainer code for Page Begin and Page End etc and for other sparse types
Use Numpy for matrix multiplications etc
Need a lot of training data (Atleast 100 pdf files)
Implement CRF generically so that new features can be added later on
Trying out Gibbs Sampling for training
For fonts 


Handling Discrete and Continous Feature Parameter and Weights?????????????????????????????????????
Should label other kind of sparse lines too?
Should the training data contain the sparse lines detected by preprocessor?
what is the gaussian prior and L1 regularization used for?
Learning CRF other algorithms - LBFGS, Newton Method etc?
