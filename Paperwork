Points:
Introduction
Why we chose this problem?
	Error Analysis done on an existing IE system (GDD) showed us that there will be 5.6% improvement in PR.
Why concentrating on pdf documents?
	papers are published mostly as pdf docs.
What does experimental results show you?
How the remaining of the paper is organised?

Table Extraction Using CRF:
	Doing for HTML Tables.
	Based on structure of the tables in the documents
Table Seer 
	Table search engine 
	Futurework ??? Can think of saying that we plan to build an information extraction system and not only a search engine
	Heuristic method (Page box cutting method) Eg: Considers only that the table captions are above the table
	May be below.. may not be there
	Fixed font size for all the table information

Table Header Detection: [To be filled by ji]




Identifying table boundaries:
	We use the concepts specified in this paper and we validate the results specified in this paper.
	They tried CRF and SVM linear. But we find SVM with a gaussian kernel perfoms better.
	Also, some post processing with a lot of knobs performs really well
